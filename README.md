# Number-Recognition: Handwritten Digit Recognition using Neural Network

This project demonstrates handwritten digit recognition using a neural network trained on the MNIST dataset. It includes code for data preprocessing, model building, training, evaluation, and visualizations.

## Overview
The goal of this project is to recognize handwritten digits (0-9) from the MNIST dataset using a neural network. The project achieves the following key objectives:
- Data loading and preprocessing
- Neural network model creation and compilation
- Model training and evaluation
- Visualization of training history
- Sample predictions display


## Tools and Technologies
- Python: The primary programming language used.
- TensorFlow: Deep learning framework for building and training neural networks.
- Keras: High-level neural networks API (integrated with TensorFlow).
- Matplotlib: Library for creating visualizations.

## Prerequisites
Before running the code, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:
- Python 3.6 or later version
- TensorFlow
- Matplotlib

## Usage

1. Install the required libraries using the following command

        pip install tensorflow matplotlib

2. Clone this repository to your local machine.

        https://github.com/varun14r/Number-Recognition.git
      
4. Run the provided Python script

         NumberRecognition.pynb
 in your preferred Python environment.
4. The script will load the MNIST dataset, train a neural network, evaluate its accuracy, and display sample predictions.
